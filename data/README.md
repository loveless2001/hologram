# Sample images

This directory ships with two small 32×32 PNG placeholders used by the demo
scripts:

- `cat.png` — warm-toned checkerboard representing a "cat".
- `dog.png` — cool-toned checkerboard representing a "dog".

Feel free to replace them with your own images when experimenting with CLIP
retrieval.
