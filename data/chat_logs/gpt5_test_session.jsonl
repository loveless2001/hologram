{"role": "assistant", "content": "Short answer: a photon does not have a meaningful “perspective” of time. In relativity, time for an object is what a clock moving with it measures (its proper time). For anything that moves at the speed of light, the proper time along its path is zero. That means a photon does not “age,” and you cannot build a rest frame in which the photon is at rest and carries a clock.\n\nKey points:\n- Proper time and the c limit: For an object moving at speed v, its clock runs slower by the factor sqrt(1 − v^2/c^2). As v approaches c, this factor tends to zero. For a massless particle that always moves at c, the elapsed proper time along its worldline is exactly zero.\n- No rest frame for light: Lorentz transformations become singular at v = c, so there is no valid inertial frame “from the photon’s point of view.” Talking about what the photon “experiences” is therefore not physically well-defined.\n- Null paths: Photons follow null (lightlike) worldlines, for which the spacetime interval is zero. That’s the precise statement of “no proper time elapsing” between emission and absorption, even though other observers can measure years, millennia, or billions of years between those events.\n- Observer dependence of energy and frequency: A photon’s frequency and energy are not its own intrinsic ticking; they depend on the observer’s motion and gravitational potential. Redshift and blueshift reflect how different observers’ clocks compare, not a time kept by the photon.\n- Role of c: The speed of light c is the invariant speed that structures spacetime. It’s the boundary between timelike motion (v < c, clocks exist) and lightlike motion (v = c, no proper time). All massless particles travel at c in vacuum, and c sets the conversion between units of space and time.\n\nPractical takeaway: You can say “no time passes for a photon between emission and detection” in the precise sense that its proper time is zero, but you cannot ascribe a genuine frame, sequence of moments, or experiences to the photon itself.", "timestamp": 1764095004.4583662}
{"role": "user", "content": "Now connect that to the concept of entropy and the arrow of time. Does a photon experience entropy?", "timestamp": 1764095053.1193943}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Short version: a lone photon doesn’t “experience” entropy or a flow of time. Entropy and its arrow are properties of macroscopic or statistical descriptions (ensembles, subsystems, environments) evolving in time; a photon has no rest frame and no proper time, so there’s no intrinsic thermodynamic evolution to ascribe to it. But radiation fields do carry entropy and are deeply involved in irreversible processes that define the arrow of time for other systems.\n\nHow the pieces fit together\n- No proper time for light: Along a photon’s lightlike path the proper time is zero, so there’s no meaningful internal clock or “aging.” That already makes talk of a photon’s own thermodynamic arrow ill-defined.\n- Entropy is statistical: Entropy belongs to states of many degrees of freedom or to mixed/uncertain states. A single, isolated photon in a pure quantum state has zero von Neumann entropy. If the photon is entangled with other systems, its reduced state can have nonzero entropy, but that entropy quantifies our lack of information about correlations, not something the photon “feels.”\n- Radiation can carry entropy: An ensemble of photons does have thermodynamic entropy. Thermal (blackbody) radiation has entropy density s = 4u/(3T) and an average entropy per photon of about 3.6 k_B. Coherent light (ideal laser) carries much less entropy per unit energy than thermal light.\n- Arrow of time and photons:\n  - Microscopic electrodynamics is (to a very good approximation) time-reversal symmetric. The macroscopic thermodynamic arrow arises from special low-entropy initial conditions and from coarse-graining, not from any asymmetry in a single photon.\n  - Photons enable irreversibility by transporting energy and entropy. Emission from hot matter and absorption by cooler surroundings produce entropy increases ΔS ≥ E/T in the absorber (more, if the absorption is not quasistatic). Scattering and decoherence entangle radiation with matter, increasing the entropy of subsystems even though the total closed-system evolution is unitary.\n  - In free, noninteracting propagation (including adiabatic cosmological redshift), the entropy of a comoving volume of radiation is conserved; the arrow shows up when interactions and coarse-graining enter.\n- No contradiction with “no time for a photon”: The arrow of time is about ordered changes in macroscopic states parameterized by the time of some observer’s frame. A photon’s null proper time doesn’t block those changes; it just means the photon itself doesn’t supply a rest-frame clock or its own thermodynamic history.\n\nBottom line: A photon does not have its own experience of entropy. But collections of photons can have entropy, and radiation is a primary channel through which entropy is generated and exported, underpinning the thermodynamic arrow of time we observe.", "timestamp": 1764095053.121174}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "- In special relativity there is no valid inertial frame moving at the speed of light, so a literal “photon’s point of view” does not exist. You cannot define coordinates in which a photon is at rest.\n\n- What we can say rigorously is that light travels on null (lightlike) worldlines. The spacetime interval along such a path is zero, so the proper time between emission and absorption is zero. In that mathematical sense a photon does not “age,” and there is no internal clock ticking along its path.\n\n- This meshes with time dilation: the dilation factor gamma = 1/sqrt(1 − v^2/c^2) grows without bound as v approaches c. Clocks carried by objects that get arbitrarily close to c tick arbitrarily slowly relative to a given inertial observer. At v = c the formula is undefined; it’s a limit, not a state a massive clock can reach.\n\n- The speed of light c is not special because of light per se; it’s a property of spacetime. It’s the invariant conversion factor that sets the boundary between timelike (slower-than-c) and spacelike (faster-than-c) separations and defines the light cone. Only massless particles move at c in vacuum, and nothing with mass can be accelerated to c.\n\n- Observers do measure finite travel times and distances for light, and they measure frequencies/energies (E = h f) that depend on their motion and gravitational potential. But none of that implies an intrinsic “photon time”; along a null path the photon has no proper time. In fact, in the geometric-optics picture the field’s phase is constant along a light ray, underscoring the absence of an internal tick.\n\n- In curved spacetime the statement remains: photons follow null geodesics, experience gravitational redshift and Shapiro delay as seen by observers, yet the proper time along their paths is still zero.\n\nSummary: There is no meaningful rest-frame perspective for a photon. Relativity instead tells us that anything moving at c traverses a null path with zero proper time, which is why a photon “experiences no time,” while observers at rest or moving subluminally record finite times and distances for its journey.", "timestamp": 1764095262.1124337}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Short answer: a single photon has no “own time” and, by itself, no thermodynamic entropy. But radiation as a field (an ensemble of photons) absolutely carries and transports entropy, and photons are central to how the thermodynamic arrow of time plays out for systems that do have clocks.\n\nConnecting time at c to the arrow of time\n- Special relativity: along a lightlike worldline the proper time is zero, so there is no meaningful rest-frame or internal clock for a photon. Without an intrinsic time parameter, it’s not meaningful to speak of a photon’s personal “arrow of time.”\n- The thermodynamic arrow is defined with respect to clocks of timelike observers: entropy tends to increase as measured in their time. That arrow comes from initial conditions and dynamics (second law), not from the value of c.\n\nDo photons “experience” entropy?\n- Single photon:\n  - Thermodynamics: entropy and temperature are macroscopic or many-degree-of-freedom notions. A lone photon has no thermodynamic temperature or entropy.\n  - Quantum information: if the photon is in a pure quantum state, its von Neumann entropy is zero. If it is in a mixed state (e.g., uncertain polarization/frequency or entangled with an environment and you trace out the rest), you can assign a positive entropy to that mixed state—but that’s a property of our description, not something the photon “feels.”\n- Ensembles/fields:\n  - A radiation field has well-defined entropy. Blackbody radiation has entropy density s = (4/3) a T^3 and number density n ∝ T^3, giving an average entropy per photon of about 3.6 k_B.\n  - Free streaming conserves this radiative entropy locally (the photon occupation number is conserved along null rays in the absence of interactions). Emission, absorption, and scattering with matter generally increase total entropy.\n\nHow photons relate to the macroscopic arrow\n- Photons are the main carriers by which hot systems dump entropy into their surroundings. Example: the Sun-Earth system. Earth absorbs high-temperature solar photons and reradiates many more lower-energy infrared photons; for the same energy flow this produces more accessible microstates, increasing the universe’s entropy. That entropy flow underlies the familiar arrow of time in climate, chemistry, and life.\n- In cosmology, the photon bath (CMB) cools and redshifts as the universe expands; in adiabatic epochs the comoving entropy in radiation is conserved, while irreversible processes (e.g., scatterings, matter-radiation interactions) generate entropy.\n\nBottom line: a photon has no intrinsic time or thermodynamic entropy to “experience.” Yet photons as a collective carry entropy and enable entropy production in systems that do have a meaningful time parameter, and it’s along those systems’ timelike clocks that the thermodynamic arrow of time is defined.", "timestamp": 1764095346.0586913}
